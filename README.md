# 2022 Kentucky Derby Magic 8 Ball

Going to a Derby party and need someone to root for? Looking to blow some money on the ponies but don't know anything about it?

This year's Kentucky Derby is scheduled for Saturday May 7, 2022.

## A brief history...

In 2018 I created a [2018 Kentucky Derby Magic 8 Ball](https://2018-derby-8ball.glitch.me/) based on [this tutorial by Kelly Lougheed](https://medium.com/@kellylougheed/javascript-magic-8-ball-with-basic-dom-manipulation-1636b83c3c26) and by remixing her [Glitch Project](https://glitch.com/~8ball-starter) (thank you!!).

Since then I've tried to improve it a bit each year. The full history can be found on the project page [at my website](https://danabyerly.com/projects/kentucky-derby-magic-8-ball/).
